‚ö† this extension is deprecated! check out the new fully featured extension over at [Scratch Addons](https://scratchaddons.com/). in Scratch Addons, it has been renamed to "Forum Image Uploader" 

this repository remains as an archive, and to report bugs with the new version of the addon in Scratch Addons 

# üìÅ scratch-image-uploader
a chrome(ium) extension which allows image uploading directly through scratch 
## üíæ Installation
[get it from the chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scratch-image-uploader/ofjfkbdgogigeclofnlgpbimaaohkjoo) or [install it using chrome's built in development mode for extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted)

## üìú Usage as a userscript
while not officially supported (there might be random issues), you can also use it as a userscript and it should work fine. until a better solution for firefox support is done, this is the only way to use it on firefox.

[click here to install userscript](https://gist.github.com/JeffaloBob/9ad73b0728863f85832bb6703b6b7875/raw/scratch-image-uploader.user.js)

thanks to [@Boomer001](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Boomer001/) for the conversion!

## üìù TODO
- switch to using assets instead of project thumbnails (needs discussion)

- add a menu for changing an image after it's been done. (needs design)

- add user feedback when using drag and drop

- i dont know if this is possible or not, but perhaps when adding the file upload button in, it could be done in a way that it looks like it all loads at the same time?
